## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design

### What I learned

While building this project, I reinforced my understanding of semantic HTML structure, effective use of CSS custom properties, and responsive design principles using Flexbox and Grid. I also practiced creating layouts that adapt across mobile and desktop breakpoints.

Here’s a CSS snippet I’m particularly proud of, used for responsive button layouts:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  .download-div {
    flex-direction: row;
    width: 50%;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving in the following areas:

- Writing cleaner, more modular CSS
- Accessibility enhancements for better user experience
- Implementing components using a modern JS framework like React

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped clarify a few layout issues during implementation.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Useful for feedback and inspiration.
